# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- What was your motivation? My motivation was wanting to gain a new skill and sufficient knowledge to help me throughout the next 6 months of my course. 
- Why did you build this project? I built this project to incorporate all the pieces of web development. I wanted to showcase HMTL, CSS and JS all in one easy-to-use study guide webpage. It provides helpful study material, as well as thought out real-world problems that can be solved through software engineering.
- What problem does it solve? It helps beginners like myself comprehend detailed web development topics, such as basic HTML, CSS and JS. Having compact and succint bullet points of information is a great way to study and learn new information.
- What did you learn? I learned a lot regarding Git, GitHub, and VS Code. I have very limited experience when it comes to creating a webpage using vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. However, this project was incredibly helpful in teaching me how to create a code base, create branches, merge said branches, and use the terminal to communicate back and forth with VS Code and GitHub. I learned the importance of debugging, as well as version control and why we need to save our progress along the way during projects. I am hopeful that all of this work will help with kicking off my bootcamp.
