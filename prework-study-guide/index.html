        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        </li>It is important to utilize semantic HTML.</li>
        <li>The header values should always remain in order (ie. h1 through h6). This is especially helpful for accessibiliy purposes.</li>
        <li>All of the information listed in the head element is NOT shown to the user.</li>
        <li>HTML is like the foundational pieces of a house. Later, CSS will be used to paint the house and make it look visibly appealing. And lastly, JS will help make it completely functional, like having doors and windows that open, usable water and electricity, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is helpful in adding designs and graphics to a web application.</li>
          <li>This language helps to add color and organization into a webpage</li>
          <li>There are a lot of style options to choose from and CSS helps us dictate that and present a web page in very specific ways, depending on our style guide.</li>
          <li>External Style Sheets are most common when using the CSS language. It allows developers to keep their CSS rules in a separate file, making it easier to change their page styling. You have to link this in the head section of the HTML.</li>
          <li>When you add padding to an element, you are actually increasing the size of the whole element. Whereas, a margin simply adds space around said element. They can't be seen, but you will notice a difference to your elements when adding either of these.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is like GitBash, but for MacOS. GitBash is for Windows.</li>
          <li></li>Git and Git bash are one in the same; synonomous. Git is software on the computer that already exists, which tracks changes I make to code.</li>
          <li>You can utilize Git commands and functions on a Mac by using the Terminal.</li>
          <li>This allows you to communicate with the computer like a regular user would via a GUI. It also syncs up nicely to an online development software like GitHub.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git pull: fetches and merges code into the current branch you're working on.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>ProTips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used interchangeably in the web development world, but it is important to know the difference. An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.”</li>
      </ul>

     <section class="card" id="real-world-problems">
      <h2>Real World Problems to Solve</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Instructional guides and reasearch for womens reproductive organs and health, specifically as it relates to their menstrual cycle. Detailed information on possible symptoms, causes of said symptoms, what to eat throughout cycle, supplements to take, etc. As detailed as possible for every day of the cycle. </li>
        <li>Better team collaboration and communication in agile development teams. When joining a new team or trying to increase collaboration, things get forgotten or skipped over. It would be nice to have a better way to document necessary knowledge and information, and also streamline processes in an easy, compatible way. Would make things easier for onboarding and team engagement overall.</li>
